/**
 * Runs this plugin's privileged commands through whichever channel the
 * panel actually has: a root shell, or Shizuku, or neither.
 *
 * <h2>Why this plugin needs a second channel at all</h2>
 *
 * Direct {@code su} is granted per app UID. Uninstalling and reinstalling
 * Kiosk Satellite gives it a new UID, so a Magisk grant made before the
 * reinstall no longer applies afterwards — the plugin reports "root isn't
 * available" on a panel that is demonstrably rooted, until someone
 * notices and re-grants it. Shizuku's authorization is held by Shizuku
 * against the KS package, so it survives that. On a panel with both, this
 * plugin keeps working through whichever one is currently answering.
 *
 * <h2>Order, and why root comes first</h2>
 *
 * Root wins when both are available: the persistent session in
 * {@link RootShell} costs one grant for the plugin's lifetime and then a
 * write-and-read per command, whereas every Shizuku call is a fresh round
 * trip through a binder to a helper process. Shizuku is the fallback for
 * panels without usable root, not a replacement for it.
 *
 * <h2>The privilege gap is real here</h2>
 *
 * Unlike the read-only probes in the Network Diagnostics plugin, the
 * commands behind this one write: {@code setprop persist.adb.tcp.port}
 * and {@code setprop ctl.restart adbd} are property writes Android gates
 * by the caller's context, and a Shizuku server started from ADB runs as
 * shell (UID 2000), not root. Shell may or may not be permitted to set
 * these on a given firmware, so Shizuku-as-shell is attempted rather than
 * assumed: a refusal surfaces as an ordinary command failure and the
 * status text says which channel was used, so "it failed on this panel"
 * is diagnosable instead of mysterious. A Shizuku started from a root
 * shell (UID 0) has no gap at all and behaves exactly like {@code su}.
 *
 * <h2>Shell syntax still works</h2>
 *
 * {@code executeShizuku} takes an absolute executable and an argument
 * array, with no shell interpretation — but {@code /system/bin/sh} is an
 * absolute executable, so passing {@code sh -c <script>} keeps {@code &&}
 * chains working exactly as they do under root. What changes between the
 * two channels is the permissions the commands run with, never the syntax
 * they are written in.
 *
 * <h2>Blocking on an async call</h2>
 *
 * The host answers {@code executeShizuku} on its own worker thread, not
 * the caller's, so waiting on a latch here blocks only this plugin's
 * worker and cannot deadlock against the host. The wait is bounded past
 * the command's own timeout so a host that never answers still returns
 * control instead of pinning the thread.
